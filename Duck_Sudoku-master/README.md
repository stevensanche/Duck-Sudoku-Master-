# Sudoku

A solver for the classic puzzle, as a programming 
project for CIS 211 at University of Oregon. 

The project will have two phases.  In the first phase 
we implement constraint propagation to solve simple 
puzzles.  In the second phase we will add back-tracking
search to solve harder puzzles. 

We will use a model-view-controller organization to 
associate a graphical display with the game.
