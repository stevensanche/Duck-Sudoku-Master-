# Sample puzzles

Most of these puzzles are taken from the Sadman Sudoku site, 
and all are in the Sadman Sudoku .sdk format.  
Additional sample files are available at 
http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/solvingtechniques.php 
under particular solving techniques.  

evil.sdk, which is designed to require backtrack search, was generated by https://www.websudoku.com/?level=4 .
It does not seem to be any more evil than the Sadman Sudoku example files. 


## Tiny examples

Most of the files are complete puzzles, but two are small examples that are useful in testing. 

naked_single_example.sdk is the illustration of a single inference using the naked single tactic.  It starts as 
```
.........
......1..
......7..
......29.
........4
.83......
......5..
.........
.........
```
and after solving with constraint propagation alone you should have 

```
.........
......1..
......7..
......29.
........4
.83...6..
......5..
.........
.........
```
(If you use backtracking, you will get *a* solution, but it is not a unique solution.) 

Similarly, hidding_single_example.sdk is 

```
.........
...2.....
.........
....6....
.........
....8....
.........
.........
.....2...
```
from which you should be able to infer one tile using constraint propagation alone: 
```
.........
...2.....
.........
....6....
....2....
....8....
.........
.........
.....2...
```

## Bad

bad.sdk is a board with duplicates.  It should be rejected.  Standard Sudoku 
puzzles never have duplicates. 

## Jurokudoku

hexa1.sdk and hexa2.sdk are 16x16 puzzles using hexadecimal digits 0..9 and A..F.  
Some people call puzzles of this kind "hexoku" or "hexosudoku", but mixing 
Greek and Japanese is odd ... it seems that they might better be called 
jurokudoku. 

## Others

All other provided examples are 9x9 and have a unique solution, 
as do all standard Sudoku puzzles. 
nakedsingle1.sdk can be solved using only the naked single tactic, 
and those named nakedhiddensingleN.sdk for N=2,3,4,5 can be solved
 using a combination of naked single and hidden single.  
 The forcingchain1.sdk and forcingchain2.sdk could be solved by a technique 
 called *forcing chain*, as you might surmise, but that is essentially a 
 limited version of backtrack searching; we will solve it with search.  
 evil.sdk is designed to require backtrack search.  veryhard.sdk is 
 another board found online which was supposedly rated very hard, and 
 which requires backtracking.
